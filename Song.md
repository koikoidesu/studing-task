### *TELEKINESIS* - _Rust_ ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn8BDLw-8bk "click here to watch MV"))
  + I've got a heart but it's afraid to **love**
  + Sometimes I think the damn thing's full of __rust__
    - And every time it seems to skip a beat
    - Or two or four or five or sometimes three
  + It pumps something that I cannot call blood
  + And why'd it have to stop when you said love
    - 'Cause don't you know that at the thought of it
    - The sucker goes ahead and calls it quits
  + And Henrietta, i've got it bad
  + And Henrietta, it makes me sad
  + And Henrietta, *it's just a fact (4)*
    - *Oh no oh oh oh oh oh oh*
    - *Oh no no no no no no no ~~(4)~~ (2)*
1. I've got a heart but it's afraid to ***love***
2. Sometimes I think the damn thing's full of __*rust*__
